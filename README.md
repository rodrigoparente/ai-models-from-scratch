# AI From Scratch

In this repository, you will find the implementation of some well-known Artificial Intelligence algorithms like Linear and Logistic Regression and Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier. I aimed to learn the basic concepts and mathematical foundations, so only the numpy library was used. Alongside each implementation, you will find some benchmarks comparing the performance of the algorithm developed from scratch and the corresponding [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) implementation. The datasets used in the experiments are the [california housing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing.html), [breast cancer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html), and [iris](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html).
